# NGO Connect: A Platform for Donors, NGOs, and Volunteers

NGO Connect is a web-based platform that connects donors, NGOs, and volunteers to streamline the process of making donations, creating NGO events, and enrolling volunteers for those events.

- **NGO Creation & Management**: NGOs can sign up, create their profiles, and manage events, all within a single dashboard.
- **Volunteer Enrollment**: Volunteers can enroll in different events hosted by NGOs to contribute to meaningful causes.
